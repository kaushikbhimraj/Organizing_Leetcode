# Organizing_Leetcode
Leetcode provides its users with a sorted list of problems (based on frequency). 
However, the website does not provide any additional details related to CS topics or companies that most frequently ask the problems on the list. 
So you would first need to create two CSV files. The first should contain problems organized based on the frequency. 
The other should contain problem data from each company i.e, Google, Facebook, Apple, etc, organized based on frequency again. 
To acquire information for the second CSV you would need a Leetcode subscription. 

CSV File 1 (Format):


CSV File 2 (Format):


LeetCode.output():


Will create the CSV output. (Make sure to update self.projectSource to point to a preferred path on your local machine)
